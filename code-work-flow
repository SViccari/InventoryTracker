  error: unitialized constant InventoryReceipt

rails g model InventoryReceipt title:string description:text quantity:integer
  *creates 3 files

open spec/model file and add unit tests
  *this is discipline to always make a unit test after
  *created acceptance tests. It's best to add unit tests
  *before adding any logic to the app/model

run rspec spec/model file

Open app/model/inventory_receipt.rb and add validations 
  *Add validation for integers

Open the migration to reflect the required validations

rake db:migrate && rake db:rollback rake db:migrate
rake db:test:prepare

run rspec spec/models file
  *It's green! 

rspec spec/features/receive_inventory_spec.rb
  *undefined local variable or method 'new_iventory_receipt_path'

Open new controller inventory_receipts_controller.rb
  *Def the method 'new'

Create new.html.erb and utilize simple form  

Open routes file to add resources

****Now is a great time to start the server and
inspect the form in the browser****

run rspec spec/features/receive_inventory_spec.rb
  *error: the action 'create' could not be found

Open inventory_receipts_controller file to add Create Method
  *Strong Params Methd will also need to be added since params is
  *an argument for Create

rspec spec/features/receive_inventory_spec.rb
  error: expected to find text "Receipt recorded."

open application.html.erb and add flash notice

rspec spec/features/receive_inventory_spec.rb
  *Green!

Resume the second acceptance test scenario

rspec spec/features/receive_inventory_spec.rb
  *Feature tests are green!
  *Notice that HTML5 flash notice is being invoked in the       config/initializers/simple_form.rb (on line 72)
  which is causing the error message to appear in a different manner. To change this, simply uncomment the line and 
  change "true" to "false"
